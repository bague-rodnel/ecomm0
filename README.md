# Zuittzu

### Ecommerce App

Zuittzu is an ecommerce app designed with React. It was made to utilize a prior RESTful Express API project that was also built for ecommerce.

This repo is tied to the netlify deployment here:
https://zuittzu.netlify.app/

The API is here:
https://csp3-ecommercev2.herokuapp.com/

## Run

### .env

To run the app locally you will need to setup the `.env` file with the following:

`REACT_APP_API_KEY=thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog`

This key is synced to the API environment variable. The API will require this key for authentication.

`REACT_APP_API_HOST=https://csp3-ecommercev2.herokuapp.com`

Points the endpoints to the remote host.

### npm

Install dependencies:

`npm install`

Run:

`npm start`

Zuittzu was designed with the following technologies:

`React`javascript framework for component-driven design\
`Twitter Bootstrap` great UI boilerplate for modern web apps\
